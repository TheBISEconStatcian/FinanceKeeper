# FinanceKeeper

A simple application to help peope with reduced budgets keep tabs on expenses.

## The philosophy

Given some free budget to expend (i. e. income - fix costs - fix savings) 
evenly distribute the available budget into the amount of days up to the next
"full income" date. Meaning the date (most likely in periods of a month or less)
in which all incomes have entered. For most people this will just mean the date
in which the salary gets transferred to the account.
